<h2>1. Create a search</h2>

<p>Create your search by adding your keywords to a search query, choosing your category and then pressing the "save" button.</p>

<p>If you get too many results, narrow down your search by selecting a subcategory and adding a filter.</p>

<p>The region can be specified differently for each search also.
Add regions in the master region list in the home screen, by pressing "menu", "preferences", "regions".</p>

<p>To only search the header, check the "Only search titles".
For posts with only pictures, check "Has image".  To enable notifications, check "Enable notifications".</p>

<h2>2. Search Syntax</h2>

<p><b>Basic Terms</b></p>
<p>Add a word you are interested in finding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>audi</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will find only posts with 'audi'.</p> 

<p><b>Either Terms</b></p>
<p>Add a Pipe symbol to say either words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>audi | bmw</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will find only posts with 'audi' OR 'bmw' in them. Notice that it's a "|" and not "/" or any other character. If you don't have "|" try with "Â¦".</p> 

<p><b>Combined Term</b></p>
<p>Add Quotes to look more than one word together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"audi a4"</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will find only posts with 'audi' then 'a4' words together.</p> 

<p><b>Remove Terms</b></p>
<p>Add a Minus to remove post with that word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>audi -a4</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will find only posts with 'audi' that don't have 'a4' in them.</p>

<p><b>Cluster Terms</b></p>
<p>Add words in parenthesis to do complex searches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>audi (a4 | a6)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will find only posts with:<br/> 
- <i>'audi' and 'a4'</i><br/>
- <i>'audi' and 'A6'</i><br/>
- <i>'audi' & 'a4' & 'a6'</i>
</p>
